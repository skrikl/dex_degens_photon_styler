# Photon Styler - Basic Browser Extension

This is a very basic browser extension written in 10 minutes with the help of AI. It serves as a simple example for educational purposes.

## Is It Harmless?
To ensure this extension is safe, you can check the code yourself:
1. Copy the content of `content.js` and `background.js`.
2. Paste it into any AI tool (like ChatGPT) and ask it to explain the code.

## Installation
1. Download this repository as a ZIP file and extract it.
2. Open your browser's extension management page:
   - Chrome: Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Edge: Go to `edge://extensions/`
3. Enable **Developer Mode**.
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the extracted folder.

## Customization
You can easily adjust the code for **any other website**:
1. Ask AI to modify `content.js` or `background.js` for your needs.
2. Add the target site to `manifest.json` under `"matches"`.

## Final Note
I hope this example inspires you to explore browser extension development further. Happy coding! ðŸš€
